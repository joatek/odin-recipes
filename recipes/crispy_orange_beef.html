    <h2>Desription</h2>
    <p>A delicious crispy and sweet, yet mildly spiced beef stir-fry recipe. Great served with steamed rice and broccoli.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup long grain rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons orange zest</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>8 broccoli florets, lightly steamed or blanched</li>
        <li>2 cups oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay beef strips out in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Allow to dry in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, rice vinegar, orange juice concentrate, salt and soy sauce. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine rice and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender. Add more water at the end if necessary.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Toss dried beef in cornstarch to coat. Fry in the hot oil in small batches until crispy and golden brown; set aside. Drain all of the oil from the wok except about 1 tablespoon.</li>
        <li>Add orange zest, ginger and garlic to the remaining oil, and cook briefly until fragrant. Add the soy sauce mixture to the wok, bring to a boil, and cook until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Add beef, and heat through, stirring to coat. Serve immediately over steamed rice, and garnish with broccoli.</li>
    </ol>
